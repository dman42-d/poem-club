    <h1>19. diving board</h1><br>
    <p>All year long I’ve been telling people that I learned a lot about love this year. It was kind of my “thing”—this was my year of becoming better, the year I cleaned up my act, got softer, the year I started painting again, learned to code, went up two cup sizes and stopped being afraid of driving. This was the year I fell in the kind of real, adult, terrifying love that I’d never experienced before, the year that I sat in coffee shops and bars across from old friends and exes surprised to see me so happy, gesturing helplessly with my hands over whiskey in a rocks glass with a big ice cube in it, saying, <em>Something’s changed in me, I can feel it</em>. Big blue sky year, bougainvillea year, grateful year o my year of hope and exhilaration. But I looked at it head on, eyes open, unwavering.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    <p>Is love only ever a swan dive, can it ever be deliberate or does it always take us by surprise? Bare feet on the diving board, and the turquoise rippling beneath. Was I ever ready? My worst habit is that I dredge through my life to find the narrative, trying always to identify the moment when everything clicked into place and flicked on all the lights under all the doorways. How did I know. When. There was that first night, early on, when I took you up to my room and dimmed the lights and dropped yuzu oil into the diffuser and you wanted to kiss me but I wouldn’t let you. I liked you so much, and I was scared. I wanted you to use me the way I’ve always been used, to thrust into me while somewhere else music played and my mind filled up with static and flowers.</p>

    <p>But you wouldn’t do that, and you wouldn’t let me make you. You wanted to know where my mind was; you pulled me back into that small, glowing room with you, smelling of oranges. I wanted you to dominate me, but all you wanted was to understand me. We stayed there, in that place, for a long time.</p>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p>There’s always a dinner party next door when I’m with you, and a feast in my heart, and a bouquet shedding petals on the table. The candles melted down to stubs, and us up late, talking. When I think about ecstasy I usually think drug or I think honey or I think strobe lights and bass and reflections on the water, but this was never just an instant and there was no comedown just me walking forever through Brooklyn with my hand over my heart.</p>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p>I’ve always, secretly, thought of myself as a lucky person; I’ve never written about it, because I used to worry that if I spoke it aloud I would break it. I’ve never won the lottery, only raffles for art sets and picnic baskets, and that was when I was a kid, so maybe it doesn’t count. But I never miss my train, or at least never the important ones, and I’ve almost never died enough times that I’m slightly convinced that all around me is a halo of golden light. More than that, I guess I’ve cultivated being in a constant state of gratitude, as if that might mean I’ve earned it. Like it isn’t luck if you never take it for granted.</p>

    <p>For a while, and I suppose it’s still true, though now true in a different way, the clearest state I could muster was that of being grateful. “Boring and grateful, same as always.” I think that’s the luckiest thing I could ask for—to be myself, to be ordinary, and yet have so much in my heart to be thankful for. Making things. Never lonely. A city, an apartment, a prayer plant lifting its leaves up in the windowsill. Tidying up my code. Red wine, something nice, a Cotes du Rhone. Clean sheets.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p>Anyway, pretty soon we won’t be together, not in this way, not with this intensity, and for a while it crushed me and sometimes I wake up forgetting and then it crushes me and this is all to say that I’m still grateful and I still think I’m lucky. To have had this, to have learned. The worst thing I’ve done in all of this is stop eating, which really isn’t terrible in the grand scheme of things, and I’ll take care of myself again soon.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p>I always get the title of that Jack Gilbert poem—the extra-sentimental one in a series of sentimental poems, the one about a relationship ending—mixed up. I always think it’s “Falling and Flying,” but it’s actually “failing,” which I and the poem agree, is kind of an unfair concept to apply to a relationship. “But anything worth doing is worth doing badly.” I’d say that’s right. Not that we were ever bad, not that we ever could be, not that we ever did anything but try to be good, and meanwhile my plant was growing and yours was too.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p>But sometimes I think falling and what I mean is flying. Sometimes I talk about it to a friend and I don’t start crying until I get to the part where I talk about how happy you make me. When I was in Chicago earlier this year, on my way back from driving out to Iowa with Santi, I got into the city late. I was staying with my ex’s older brother and his wife, and I didn’t really know them. Before I called, before I knocked on the door, I walked to the end of the block, where it ends in sand, where the city turns to beach. It was late, and there wasn’t a single light out on the water—just darkness all around me, as far as I could see, and the edge of the world dropped away. You’ll know what it looks like. I sent you a picture.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p>The next morning, I got up early. Took the train to the airport. I was coming home; I was coming home to you. It was a little cold outside. I was wearing that orange skirt, the one that snaps against my body in the breeze. In the airport terminal, alone, silent, I’d never felt more like myself, never more at peace in the world, knowing that I was between one place and the next, that I was in transit, suspended in that taut, quiet moment before I arrived at a place where I would again collect myself and become the person I am always trying to be.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
