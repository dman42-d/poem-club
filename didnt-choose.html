<div id="poem">
and do you ever, glancing over your shoulder,
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
think about the thing you didn’t choose—
  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
How if you had said “Yes I do love you”<br><br><br><br>
in that cadence, with that look on your face<br><br><br><br>
and opened your arms to him<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
he might not have died in a climbing accident,<br><br>
or at least not pretended to—
  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
  you wrote a short story about this,<br><br><br><br><br>
in which you mix up what happened with a dream you once had<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
and what if you had stayed, then, in the place you’ve never chosen, <br><br>
  where you climbed out your bedroom window at night<br><br>
to drink wine by the creek <br><br> and watch the sun rise through the trees—<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
There’s no way to tell if you could have been any more lovely,<br><br>
any more kind or generous or good, <br><br><br><br>
  whether you chose to be with him<br><br>
or to be with no one, whether you chose<br><br>
to stay or go, which is what all choices become eventually—<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
All you know now is the space between your fingers,<br><br>
and the muscle pounding in your chest, <br><br>and you cannot imagine a world<br><br>
in which you haven’t had this improbable faith,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
the one that causes you to believe this is the only life<br><br>
  you could have possibly lived,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
the life that now unfurls before you like a magician’s trick,<br><br>
a stream of white doves disappearing into smoke,<br><br>
a chain of silk scarves, gold and blue, neverending,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
or maybe something smaller than that,<br><br>
and more possible:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
maybe the cellophane ribbons in pastel colors<br><br><br>
taped to the front of the standing fan which pivots,<br><br>
slowly, back and forth,<br><br>
in the home of the life you could have chosen.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
